A simple native android app.
Just download and build Dockerfile with "docker build -t drseyyed/studio ." . 
Then download run.sh add permission to execute (chmod +x ./run.sh) and execute it with "HOST_DISPLAY=1 ./run.sh".
It will open up android studio similar to mine with project in it.
Note: Its not work in docker desktop. Try with linux or wsl.
